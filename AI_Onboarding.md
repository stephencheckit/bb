# Beach Buddy - AI Onboarding Documentation

**Project Name**: Beach Buddy  
**Version**: 0.1.0 (MVP)  
**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025  
**Location Focus**: Palm Harbor, FL and surrounding beaches

## 🌊 Project Overview

Beach Buddy is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that acts as a smart beach day concierge. It helps users decide the best time to visit the beach by analyzing weather conditions, tides, UV index, and wind patterns, then generates personalized trip plans with smart checklists and nearby amenities.

- **3-Hour Time Windows**: Intelligent suggestions for next 12 hours
- **Smart Checklists**: Auto-generated packing lists based on conditions
- **Real-Time Data**: Weather, tides, UV, and nearby places

## 🧮 BeachScore Algorithm

### Scoring Weights (0-100 scale)
- **Temperature** (30%): Peak at 80-90°F
- **UV Safety** (25%): Lower is better
- **Wind Comfort** (25%): Lower is better
- **Tide Suitability** (10%): Slack/low tide preferred
- **Weather Conditions** (10%): Clear > Cloudy > Rain

### Score Ranges
- **80-100**: Perfect day! Go now.
- **60-79**: Pretty good—bring sunscreen
- **40-59**: Okay day, check conditions
- **<40**: Maybe tomorrow?

### Time Windows
- **Duration**: 3-hour blocks (average beach visit)
- **Forecast**: Next 12 hours (4 windows)
- **Sorting**: Best score first
- **"Go Now"**: Highlighted if current time is within best window

- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript with zero `any` types
- **PWA Ready**: Installable on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant design patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized builds with Next.js 16 + Turbopack

#### Next Steps for User
1. **Get API Keys:**
   - OpenWeather: https://openweathermap.org/api (Free tier: 1,000 calls/day)
   - OpenUV: https://www.openuv.io/ (Free tier: 50 calls/day)

2. **Create `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key
   OPENUV_API_KEY=your_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Add environment variables in dashboard
   - Deploy automatically

#### Known Considerations
- NOAA Tides API and OpenStreetMap/Overpass are free (no keys needed)
- API rate limits: OpenUV (50/day) is the bottleneck
- Icon files (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) are placeholders - need actual icons
- No auth/backend database in MVP (localStorage only)
- Geolocation requires user permission on first use

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### Phase 2 (Post-MVP)
- Supabase integration for user accounts
- Push notifications (sunscreen timer, hazards)
- Event/activity feed
- Family & friends shared plans

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- Parking & crowd predictions
- Water quality tracking
- Photo journaling & streaks
- Wearable integrations (Apple Watch)
